# Pawet
**Note this project is under development and everything can change as it goes, including this README**

## What is it?
Pawet is a new esoteric-style language inspired by [Piet](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Piet) which brings a turing-complete spin on image-based programming. The name is a portmanteau between 'Paw' and 'Piet' because why not.

## How to use
Pawet is an interpreted language, interpreted by python (for now). I know python is also an interpreted language but this adds to the humour. Download the repo and use the pawet interpreter class to interpret and execute your image programs. A full specification on how to use the program will be provided in due course.
## Planned features
So many language features and a standard Pawet library is planned. Keep checking for regular updates!
