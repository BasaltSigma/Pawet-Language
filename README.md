# Pawet
**Note this project is under development and everything can change as it goes, including this README**

## What is it?
Pawet is a new esoteric-style language inspired by [Piet](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Piet) which brings a turing-complete spin on image-based programming. The name is a portmanteau between 'Paw' and 'Piet' because why not.

## How to use
Pawet is an interpreted language, interpreted by python (for now). I know python is also an interpreted language but this adds to the humour. Download the repo and use the pawet interpreter class to interpret and execute your image programs. A full specification on how to use the program will be provided in due course.

The Pawet interpreter was written in Python 3.10. Use this or an above version to ensure compatibility
## Planned features
So many language features and a standard Pawet library is planned. Keep checking for regular updates!
